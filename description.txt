I have modified  <a href="http://www.planet-source-code.com/xq/ASP/txtCodeId.23881/lngWId.1/qx/vb/scripts/ShowCode.htm">Elad Rosenheim's "Dynamic" Resizable Skin Demo v1.2</a> to better support KewlPad skins as well as added several functionality changes to bring it closer to a complete skinnable solution.
<p>
Changes:<br>
 - All the code was removed from the form's codebase and put into a Class Module to make it reusable and easily compiled into an ActiveX DLL.&nbsp;<br>
 - Allow for A Minimum Client Area size&nbsp;<br>
 - Allow for Maximum Form Size<br>
 - Ability to make the form non-movable, non-resizeable, and/or Always OnTop.&nbsp;<br>
 - Removed the need to have a second "Hidden form" for correct Minimize events.&nbsp;<br>
 - Built in routine will reconfigure form using API calls and remove the titlebar and 3D effects, so you don't have to change the form's BorderStyle in the IDE.<br>
 - Added several events triggered when the form skinning is complete, The Minimum button was clicked, the Close button was clicked, ClientArea and Form MouseEvents, and of course on Form Resize.<br>
 - New Skin properties: FontColor, FontBold, BackColor.<br>
<br>
 Over 50 KewlPad skins are available at<br>
