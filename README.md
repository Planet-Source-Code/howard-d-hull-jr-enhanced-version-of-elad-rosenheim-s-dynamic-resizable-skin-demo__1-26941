### Description

I have enhanced <a href="http://www.planet-source-code.com/xq/ASP/txtCodeId.23881/lngWId.1/qx/vb/scripts/ShowCode.htm">Elad Rosenheim's "Dynamic" Resizable Skin Demo</a> to better support KewlPad skins as well as added several functionality changes to bring it closer to a complete skinnable solution.

<p>

Changes:<br>

- All the code was removed from the form's codebase and put into a Class Module to make it reusable and easily compiled into an ActiveX DLL.&nbsp;<br>

- Allow for A Minimum Client Area size&nbsp;<br>

- Allow for Maximum Form Size<br>

- Ability to make the form non-movable, non-resizeable, and/or Always OnTop.&nbsp;<br>

- Removed the need to have a second "Hidden form" for correct Minimize events.&nbsp;<br>

- Built in routine will reconfigure form using API calls and remove the titlebar and 3D effects, so you don't have to change the form's BorderStyle in the IDE.<br>

- Added several events triggered when the form skinning is complete, The Minimum button was clicked, the Close button was clicked, ClientArea and Form MouseEvents, and of course on Form Resize.<br>

- New Skin properties: FontColor, FontBold, BackColor.<br>

<br>

Over 50 KewlPad skins are available at<br>
