Skinning a form is extremly easy. 

Initial Setup is as follows:
  Open the SkinnedFormDLL.vbp project and compile into a DLL	(Only need to do this once)
  Start a new project. 
      From Project -> References menu, add 'Dynamic Technologies Skinned Form DLL v1.0'

Now we can skin a form:
On the form you are going to skin add a picturebox called 'picClientArea' or whatever you want. 
Any controls you are going to have on this form must be contained within this picturebox.

All Minimum.. and Maximum.. properties are in Pixels.

=============================================================================================
In the form's General Declarations section put:

    Private WithEvents m_SkinnedForm      As clsSkinnedForm



in the Form_Load routine put

    '// Code Snippet Start

    Set m_SkinnedForm = New clsSkinnedForm
    Set m_SkinnedForm.SkinnedForm = Me
    Set m_SkinnedForm.ClientArea = picClientArea	' Or what ever you called the picturebox

    m_SkinnedForm.MinimumClientAreaHeight = 250		' Optionally the clientarea picturebox height will never be less than this
    m_SkinnedForm.MinimumClientAreaWidth = 350		' Optionally the clientarea picturebox width will never be less than this

    m_SkinnedForm.MaximumFormHeight = Screen.Height / Screen.TwipsPerPixelY	' Optionally the outside Height of the Form will never be greater than this
    m_SkinnedForm.MaximumFormWidth = Screen.Width / Screen.TwipsPerPixelX	' Optionally the outside Width of the Form will never be greater than this
    
    m_SkinnedForm.SkinForm ("Default")	' PAss the Name of the skin you want to use. This is the Folder name within the Skin folder.

    '// Code Snippet End



Other optional properties that can be changed.
    
    m_SkinnedForm.Movable = {True/False}	' Boolean value to determine if the form is movable. (Default = True)
    m_SkinnedForm.Resizable = {True/False}	' Boolean value to determine if the form is Resizable. (Default = True)
    m_SkinnedForm.AlwaysOnTop = {True/False}	' Boolean value to determine if the form is OnTop of all other Windows. (Default = False)


Properties available after the form is skinned:

    m_SkinnedForm.FontColor
    m_SkinnedForm.FontBold
    m_SkinnedForm.BackColor

    These properties can be used to change the appropriate properties of the controls on the skinned form. 
    See the UpdateControls() routine in the Demo project.
